The program is written using python. So, you need a python interpreter installed (for python 2, python 3 is not backwards-compatible). It also requires the nltk library for python, which is installable by easy_install or pip. The program takes input and output filenames as command-line arguments, and always reads from "corpus.txt" file located in the same directory. (Example usage: python spellchecker.py in.txt out.txt). It was written and tested using python 2.7.5 running on ubuntu 13.10.
